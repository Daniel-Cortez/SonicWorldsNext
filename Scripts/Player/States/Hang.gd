extends PlayerState

# this state is used for reference, the hanging code for jumping off is usually handled by the object
# see hanger.gd

# DW's note:
# This state should be killed with fire, and animation should be used in its place.
# I think this one is my fault anyway. In fact, the whole hanger should be remade with it.
